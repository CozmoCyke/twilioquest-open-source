# Sync our Fork

While we've been working on our fork of the Open Pixel Art project other developers around the world might have been working on it too! We need to synchronize their changes with ours before we share.

We're going to learn how to link our local repository's upstream remote to the open-pixel-art reposistory, fetch the latest changes, and merge them into our local branch. Once we've done all that, click `HACK!`.
