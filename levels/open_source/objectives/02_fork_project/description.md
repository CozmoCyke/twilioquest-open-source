# What the Fork?

To complete this objective, [create a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of an open source git repository. We have created a project to help you practice called [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art).

Once you have [created a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) under your own GitHub account, click the *HACK* button. For more context on how repositories and forks work, check out the help section!
