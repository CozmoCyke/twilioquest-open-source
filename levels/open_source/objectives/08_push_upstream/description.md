# Paddle Upstream

Before you can submit your contribution, you must __push your development branch "upstream"__ - to [your fork of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/<%= env.TQ_GITHUB_USERNAME.value %>/open-pixel-art). This is also a great way to back up your work!

Once you have pushed your `<%= env.TQ_OPEN_PIXEL_ART_BRANCH.value %>` branch upstream to [your fork](https://github.com/<%= env.TQ_GITHUB_USERNAME.value %>/open-pixel-art), click the *HACK* button.
