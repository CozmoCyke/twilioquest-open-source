# Branching Out

To complete this challenge, [create a branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) in your local git repository. You can use the `git branch` command for this purpose:

```bash
git branch my_branch_name
git checkout my_branch_name
```

When you have created a branch, paste the name of your new branch into the text field on the right and click *HACK*.
