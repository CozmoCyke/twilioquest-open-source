# Make a Name For Yourself

Git allows you to set some [global configuration settings](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) that will apply every time you make a commit. For this objective, we will configure two global options:

* `user.name` - Your name as it will be displayed on commit messages
* `user.email` - Your contact email

Once you've configured those options using the `git config` command, click *HACK*.
