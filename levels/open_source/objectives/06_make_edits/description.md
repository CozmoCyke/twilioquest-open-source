# Making Your Mark

Now, the fun part - making your changes to the project! To open this chest and claim the __Flame of Open Source__, you must edit source code in the `open-pixel-art` project and __commit your changes__ on your development branch. See the "Help" section for instructions on how to make your change.

Once you have __committed your changes__ to your development branch - `<%= env.TQ_OPEN_PIXEL_ART_BRANCH.value %>` - click the *HACK* button.
