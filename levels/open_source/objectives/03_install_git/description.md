# Git Set Up

To complete this challenge, you must [install the git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer. You can verify that git is installed on your computer by using the following command in a terminal interface:

```bash
git --version
```

Once you have verified that `git` is installed and available on your [system path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), click the *HACK* button.
