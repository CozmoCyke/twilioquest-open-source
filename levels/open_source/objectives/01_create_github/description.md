# Git Started

Many open source projects (and many software companies) use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and collaboration. [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) is a popular platform that many open source projects use to host their [git repositories](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

The challenges to follow will take you through contributing to an open source project hosted on GitHub. The first step on that journey is [creating a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

Once you've made your free GitHub account, __enter the username you chose__ into the field on the right and press *HACK*.
