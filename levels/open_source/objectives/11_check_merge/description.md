# Merging

The final step on your open source journey is to get your Pull Request merged. This is a collaborative process where you work with the maintainers of the repository you're contributing to. You'll leave comments for each other on the Pull Request and update your code until it's in a state the maintainer is happy with.

The pull requests to the Open Pixel Art project are controlled automatically by a few different tools. If anything goes wrong, the bots will leave comments on your pull request asking for changes to be made.

Once [your Pull Request](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art/pull/<%= env.TQ_OPEN_PIXEL_ART_PR_NUMBER.value %>) is automatically merged, click `HACK` on the left to open this chest!
