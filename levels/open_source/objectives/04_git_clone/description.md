# Clone Ranger

To complete this objective, you must [clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your fork of the Open Pixel Art project. If you didn't rename your fork, it will be located here:

[https://github.com/<%= env.TQ_GITHUB_USERNAME.value %>/open-pixel-art](https://github.com/<%= env.TQ_GITHUB_USERNAME.value %>/open-pixel-art)

When you [clone a repository](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone), a local copy of the code is downloaded to your computer. Enter the __full file path__ to the folder that contains your code in the text field omn the right, then click *HACK*.
